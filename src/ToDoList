TO DO


Fixes

- Simplify code using the gameBoard static object
- Document the use of each class in Javadoc style comments

- expand to multiple players
- make boardsize private and add setter/getter
- resize the datagram smaller
- test from different computers



Optimize
- only rePaint client when Main board is repainted
- figure out how to print from the array, so only the server has to run the board
- remove TCP remnants
- use the address of the first message so that both addresses don't need to be used

Notes
-when one bomb sets off another, there will be normal fire on the same square the
    orange fire - won't cause problems as long as drawing the orange fire has higher
    precedence
