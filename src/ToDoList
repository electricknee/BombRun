TO DO
- expand to multiple players

Fixes

- Simplify code using the gameBoard statics
- Document classes with comments and remove unncessary

- make boardsize private and add setter/getter

- error where explosions persist through the end of games
- make the controllers run as threads so they can use sleep() to slow gameplay



Optimize
- resize the datagram smaller
- figure out how to print from the array, so only the server has to run the board
- remove TCP remnants
- use the address of the first message so that both addresses don't need to be used
    create a sync process

Notes
-when one bomb sets off another, there will be normal fire on the same square the
    orange fire - won't cause problems as long as drawing the orange fire has higher
    precedence (same issue with player X fire)
