TO DO
- expand to multiple players

Fixes

- Simplify code using the gameBoard statics
- Document classes with comments and remove unncessary

- make boardsize private and add setter/getter

- test from different computers / set up 



Optimize
- resize the datagram smaller
- figure out how to print from the array, so only the server has to run the board


Notes
-when one bomb sets off another, there will be normal fire on the same square the
    orange fire - won't cause problems as long as drawing the orange fire has higher
    precedence (same issue with player X fire)
