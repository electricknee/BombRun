TO DO



- Stop the Client and server from crashing if the other drops
- Simplify code using the gameBoard static object
- Document the use of each class in Javadoc style comments
- expand to multiple players
- make boardsize private and add setter/getter
- resize the datagram smaller
- make the datagram version work and test from different computers



Optimize
- only rePaint client when Main board is repainted
- figure out how to print from the array, so only the server has to run the board
